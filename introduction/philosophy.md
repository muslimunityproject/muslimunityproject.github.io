# Philosophy

The term **"open source"** refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values and some call it "the open source way." Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

It could be argued that the concept of "open source" actually was developed by Muslim scholars who developed various Islamic sciences over 1400 years. In Islam, one of the primary agreed upon sources of Islamic jurisprudence is "ijtihad" (translated as exertion) where a qualified scholar would attempt to derive hukms (rulings) for issues on which the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah were not explicit or clear. Part of the ijtihad process was assessing previous ijtihads, and this is somewhat very similar to the "open source" philosophy, whereby you take existing works and improve on them through continous development.

This project embraces the open source philosophy, whereby as more and more participants join the project, out of them they vote in those who they consider to be the most suitable or knowledgeable, and amongst the elected emerges the most suitable for evaluating the ideas of the project, whether related to the philosophy or the objectives or the actions or the structure. And this evaluation is constant and continous. And all input and suggestions from all levels are open and transparent, making it a project that truly allows innovation and creativity.

Everything is subject to evaluation and change, including every aspect of the project.

Allah SWT has promised mankind that He SWT will protect the Quran. And many ahadith inform us that there will always be khair in the ummah. So another fundamental philosophy of this project is that it be navigated and directed by the participants. As more and more join the project, more and more of the best amongst them will be elected into positions of responsibility based upon merit, and the sharpest and most knowledgeable will particpate in the evaluation of all aspects of the project, embracing the open source philosophy stated above.

And if one is worried and concerned about where this project will end up, the most suitable answer is the answer given by RasulAllah SAW when he was asked by the tribe of Banu Hanifah to give them the rule as a condition for him SAW ruling by Islam over them. He SAW responded by saying: “Authority is a matter which Allah places where He pleases.”

And similarly with this project (if it gets up and running inshAllah), after efforts are made and directions taken and ideas/aims/structure/actions evaluated and upgraded and improved - ultimately it will go to where it goes, and we trust in Allah SWT that He SWT will let it go to where He pleases.
