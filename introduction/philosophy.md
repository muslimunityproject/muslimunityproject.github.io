# Philosophy

The term **"open source"** refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.

The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values and some call it "the open source way." Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.

It could be argued that the concept of "open source" actually was developed by Muslim scholars who developed various Islamic sciences over 1400 years. In Islam, one of the primary agreed upon sources of Islamic jurisprudence is "ijtihad" (translated as exertion) where a qualified scholar would attempt to derive hukms (rulings) for issues on which the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah were not explicit or clear. Part of the ijtihad process was assessing previous ijtihads, and this is somewhat very similar to the "open source" philosophy, whereby you take existing works and improve on them through continous development.
