# Accountability

Is both public and private, with no pressure for either method to be given preference. This is because accountability brings openess and frankness and recklessness and insincerity will be up for judgement.

Confidence that the haqq will prevail over the batil, regardless of the topic being discussed, the topic being accounted on, or, or the public activity or public individual being discussed. As for private or personal matters of the individual, Islam prohibits their discussion and so backbiting must be avoided in all circumstancesAs for infiltration by the enemies of Islam, there is nothing to hide and so being secretive for practical reasons is something that units will have to assess themselves

heavy and frank accounting but with hikma and wisdom and akhlaq
