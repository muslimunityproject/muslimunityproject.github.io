# Objectives

Every Muslim should desire unity

Every Muslim has obligation and right to work for unity, following the prophetic method

Every Muslim, as long as they subscribe to the sound aqeedah, and regardless of other differences, can and should work with like minded Muslims to establish unity

Every Muslim, even if they are engaged in other activities, or works with a group/jamaah/harakat/hizb, or works for an islamic cause, can and should work for unity

E.g. leaving a hizb/jamaah/harkat should not result in inactivity and inability to continue working as part of a collective effort

The victory will come to where it is deserved and no one knows who or where this may be, and so no one can claim exclusivity or invite deservability to themselves

Recognising each others strengths, accounting each others faults

Maintaining ikhlas in the objective and not mixing with with objectives such as business or family issues or political ambitions

In general we follow the method of the prophet Muhammad and his sahabah

This is a movement for change, a movement to raise the word of Allah SWT the biggest, to bring unity, to re-establish the khilafah, to liberate occupied lands, to bring justice and resist oppression. We will decide what we want to live by, how we want to live, who we want to rule over us.

unison in global work, differences in regional and local work

Dawa is to the world, to both Muslims and non Muslims. Prioritisation of who to target, what to discuss, where to work is to be decided in consultation.

Disagreement over objectives and strategy should not result in detachment. Rather if you can convince others of your views or ideas then get elected and proceed as far as you can go. But retain attachment to the project for the sake of unity and momentum
