## What is this project?

This project is to be considered an effort from every believer who subscribes to Islam and considers it a duty to raise the Word of Allah SWT.

This is not a sect, nor a madhab, nor a political party, not a secretive organisation. It is neither of these because none of these terms describes it accurately. The most accurate description is that it is a project, where participants come together to work collectively on the project for the objectives that it defines.

It should be considered a project, where any and everyone can contribute their efforts.

It is not a secular project, nor a political project, but rather it is an Islamic project as the aim is .

Many Muslims are skeptical of various groups and movements currently present in the ummah. This skeptiscisim is justified in many cases, but is similarly not justified in many cases.

There is good and bad, and there are different views on who is good and who is bad, and this project aims to get past these issues onto a more general position, where there is no differences, or at least where differences are minimised.

This is a project that has emanated from the ummah, is comprised of people from the ummah, both daees and scholars, united on core issues which are agreed upon, with ideas and objectives that are continously being improved and polished.

The aim is to achieve the maqam of khairun ummati, and the path that will be taken will be shaped by all who participate in the work, with a continous improvment process that should sharpen the aims and facilitate the actions and activities that are collectivly agreed upon.

All culture is subject to continous examination and improvements, with ulema from across the ummah constantly purifying and sharpening the culture, and their positions are elected positions, and their positions can change if the shura councils vote them in or vote them out.

The fundamental basis of the movement is that the ummah will select its leaders, the ummah will select its scholars, and the ummah will select what direction it wants to go, with differences minimised and objectives agreed upon via concensus.
