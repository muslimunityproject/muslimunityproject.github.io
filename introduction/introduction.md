# Introduction

Bismillahir rahmanir raheem...

The Muslim world is reeling from one disaster to another disaster, from one trial to another tribulation. From the official abolishment of the Khilafah in 1924 to the Zionist occupation of Al Quds, to the relentess wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen (and countless others in recent history), there no abating in the tyranny and oppression that has befallen the Muslim ummah. However there is little doubt amongst Muslims that what we are lacking in order to address our situation is **unity**.

The Muslim world lacks unity in many respects - unity in thought, unity of purpose, unity in action. Divisions amongst us are exploited and amplified by those who wish to see Muslims disunited, and Muslims must now take matters into their own hands now and work for unity dilligently, utilising means santioned by the Sharia, and then trusting and praying to Allah SWT to bring about the victory in the form of unity.

The work for unity amongst Muslims ultimately leading to unity under a Khilafah has to a collective effort. It requires collective efforts and resources, and it cannot and must not be impeded by differences or inhibitions or dislikes amongst each other as the objective is too great, the stakes are too high. Too many Muslims and Muslim groups allow differences to come in between each other, and instead of working together for common objectives, they find themselves working against each others efforts, leading to all their efforts becoming exhausted and ineffective as a result.
