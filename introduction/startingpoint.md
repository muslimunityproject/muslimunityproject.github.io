# Starting Point

It is anticipated that this project will gain traction amongst existing daees and Islamic activists, whether they are currently with a group/movement/party or not, who appreciate the reasoning behind the project, and have come across obstacles in the dawa which this project is trying to overcome.

Whilst there may be an initial influx of participants from common backgrounds, it is the sincere objective of this project to involve as many participants from a wide variety of backgroyunds and thinkninbg, as that will only enrich the project and help drive the purification of ideas after continual assessments and contemplation.
