# Project Structure

Two structures

1. Scholarship - unifying on general principles, setting general objectives of the dawa, deciding on what to adopt and what not to adopt. All adoptions will be based on collective agreement with the majority vote. Whilst we recognise in Islam that the minority opinion may ultimately be the correct ijtihad, the council of ulema will take adoptions correctively as the notion of collective agreement is well established.

2. Dawa activities -Â 
Both structures will be elected on merit
Central objective to establish Islam as basis for everything
Carrying the islamic dawa
Avoidance of controversial topics
Open accountabilityNo adoption on political analysisOnly promote agreed islamic ideas
Adoption by consensus with guidance from traditional Islamic scholarship
No adoption on issues where well known difference of opinion exists
Not engaging in belligerent seeking of nussrah
Loose open membership
Limited term leadership roles
Leadership is elected
No money is managed centrally, all activities self funded
Detachment from physical actions, charity, political campaigns
