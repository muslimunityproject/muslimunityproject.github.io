# Structure

Participants should join the project on a loose affiliation. A loose affiliation means they agree with the general objectives and actions and ideas and commit to working with the project.

This is an open project, with open arms to all. Sincere participants will inshAllah be attracted to the project because of the Islamic aims, merit based structure, open source philosophy and actions based upon consensus.

If someone agrees and wants to join the project they can do so easily with a quick and simple on-boarding process.

There is no compulsion, there are no oaths, all efforts and work are purely voluntary and motivated by Islamic objectives.

If someone wants to leave due to no longer agreeing with the direction of the project or the ideas or the work, that is upto them and we wish them all success in their lives.


Two structures may emerge (this as with everything is subject to change/improvement):

1. Scholarship - unifying on general principles, setting general objectives of the dawa, deciding on what to adopt and what not to adopt. All adoptions will be based on collective agreement with the majority vote. Whilst we recognise in Islam that the minority opinion may ultimately be the correct ijtihad, the council of ulema will take adoptions correctively as the notion of collective agreement is well established.

2. Dawa activities -Â 
Both structures will be elected on merit
Central objective to establish Islam as basis for everything
Carrying the islamic dawa
Avoidance of controversial topics
Open accountabilityNo adoption on political analysisOnly promote agreed islamic ideas
Adoption by consensus with guidance from traditional Islamic scholarship
No adoption on issues where well known difference of opinion exists
Not engaging in belligerent seeking of nussrah
Loose open membership
Limited term leadership roles
Leadership is elected
No money is managed centrally, all activities self funded
Detachment from physical actions, charity, political campaigns


### How will the project structure emerge?

From the ground up...

5 from London => elect a London Amir
5 from Luton => elect a Luton Amir
5 from Birmingham => elect a Birmingham Amir
5 from Manchester => elect a Manchester Amir
5 from Wales => elect a Wales Amir

These 5 form the national UK committee and elect an Amir for the UK

Similarly Amirs emerge from numerous countries, e.g. US, Australia, Germany,
