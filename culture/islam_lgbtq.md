# Example Islam & LGBT

Western society today promotes LGBTQ relationships as perfectly normal and wants Muslim and other non Western countries to adopt the same values.

The first question that must be asked is what or who defines what is and what isn't acceptable relationships between men and women, men and men, women and women and so on.

Islam's position is very clear. There is no confusion on what Islam considers as right or wrong, and these values have
remained the same for the last 1400+ years since the advent of the Prophet Muhammad SAW.

We view LGBTQ relationships in the same manner as we view the consumption of alcohol, or adultery, or lying - they are all
considered wrong or bad, and considered as sins which the person will be accountable for in the next life.

Muslims don't need the West to lecture us about what is morally right or wrong. This is due to another of reasons:
- Western values are constantly in flux and has no consistentcy
- Western values come from a process where humans are empowered to make lgisture on behalf of the population. But who gave them the authority to determine what is right or what is wrong
- We prefer to be lectured by the Creator of humans, who is neither a man or a woman

The question of whether it is natural or it is a choice
- for us this is irrelevant
- biologically abominable
- lead to death of society
- bullying of such children
- motherhood and fatherhood
- role models
- incidence of STDs
- sexual satisfaction
