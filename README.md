## Overview

وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ - 3:103

*"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided." (Al-Imran:102)*

وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ - 3:104

*"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful." (Al-Imran:103)*


This project is to be considered an effort from every believer who subscribes to Islam and considers it a duty to work for unity.

This is not a sect, nor a madhab, nor a political party, not a secretive organisation. It is neither of these because none of these terms describes it accurately. The most accurate description is that it is a project, where participants come together to work collectively in the project for the objectives that it defines.

It should be considered a project, where any and everyone can contribute their efforts and ideas, and be stakeholders in what direction it takes and how it operates.

It is not a secular project, nor a political project, but rather it is an Islamic project as the aim is an Islamic aim to restore unity amongst Muslims at every level possible.

Many Muslims are skeptical of various groups and movements currently present in the ummah. This skeptiscisim is justified in many cases, but similarly not justified in many cases. There is good and bad, and there are different opinions on who is good and who is bad, and this project aims to get past these issues onto a more general position, where there is unity on core issues, and where differences are minimised.

This is a project that emanats from the ummah, is comprised of people from the ummah, both simple Muslims as well as experienced daees and scholars, all united on core issues which are agreed upon, with ideas and objectives that are continously being improved and polished.

The aim is to achieve the type of unity expected from Islam, and the path that will be taken will be shaped by all who participate in the project, with a continous improvment process that will sharpen the aims and facilitate the actions and activities that are collectivly agreed upon.

All culture is subject to continous examination and improvements, with the most knowledgeable from across the ummah stepping forward to come together for the common objectives, constantly purifying and sharpening the ideas & culture.

All positions of leadership at all levels are elected positions - whether local, regional, national or international, and all leadership positions can change if the underlying shura committees vote them in or vote them out. This ensures a healthy project leadership structure, constantly selecting leaders amongst the participants, with the best leaders emerging based on their merit.

The fundamental basis of this project is that participants in the project will determine the ideas and ways to achieve unity via consensus, the project will select its leaders and management structure, the project will select its scholars, and the project will select what direction it wants to go, with differences minimised and objectives agreed upon via consensus.
