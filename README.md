## Overview

وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا ۚ وَاذْكُرُوا نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاءً فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىٰ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ - 3:103

"And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided." (Al-Imran:102)

وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ - 3:104

"And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and those will be the successful." (Al-Imran:103)

Every Muslim should desire khilafah

Every Muslim has obligation and right to work for khilafah, of course following prophetic method

Every Muslim, as long as they subscribe to the sound aqeedah, and regardless of other differences, can and should work with like minded Muslims to re-establish the khilafah

Every Muslim, even if they are engaged in other activities, or works with a group/jamaah/harakat/hizb, or works for an islamic cause, can and should work for k

The work for khilafah is a collective effort, it requires collective efforts and resources, and it cannot and must not be impeded by differences or inhibitions or dislikes as the objective is too great, the stakes too high. E.g leaving a hizb/jamaah/harkat should not result in inactivity and inability to continue working as part of a collective effort

The victory will come to where it is deserved and no one knows who or where this may be, and so no one can claim exclusivity or invite deservability to themselves

Recognising each others strengths, accounting each others faultsMaintaining ikhlas in the objective and not mixing with with objectives such as business or family issues or political ambitionsIn general we follow the method of the prophet Muhammad and his sahabah

Private halaqah, public dawa, seeking nussrah

Seeking the nussrah is done in a sincere way, giving naseehah, inviting nussrah to obey Allah SWT and this messenger

Two structures

1. Scholarship - unifying on general principles, setting general objectives of the dawa, deciding on what to adopt and what not to adopt. All adoptions will be based on collective agreement with the majority vote. Whilst we recognise in Islam that the minority opinion may ultimately be the correct ijtihad, the council of ulema will take adoptions correctively as the notion of collective agreement is well established.

2. Dawa activities - 
Both structures will be elected on merit
Central objective to establish Islam as basis for everythingCarrying the islamic dawa
Avoidance of controversial topics
Open accountabilityNo adoption on political analysisOnly promote agreed islamic ideas
Adoption by consensus with guidance from traditional Islamic scholarshipNo adoption on issues where well known difference of opinion exists
Not engaging in belligerent seeking of nussrah
Loose open membership
Limited term leadership roles
Leadership is elected
No money is managed centrally, all activities self funded
Detachment from physical actions, charity, political campaigns
Confidence that the haqq will prevail over the batil, regardless of the topic being discussed, the topic being accounted on, or, or the public activity or public individual being discussed. As for private or personal matters of the individual, Islam prohibits their discussion and so backbiting must be avoided in all circumstancesAs for infiltration by the enemies of Islam, there is nothing to hide and so being secretive for practical reasons is something that units will have to assess themselves

This is a movement for change, a movement to raise the word of Allah SWT the biggest, to re-establish the khilafah, to liberate occupied lands, to bring justice and resist oppression. We will decide what we want to live by, how we want to live, who we want to rule over us.

Dawa is to the world, to both Muslims and non Muslims. Prioritisation of who to target, what to discuss, where to work is to be decided in consultation. However disagreement over objectives and strategy should not result in detachment. Rather if you can convince others of your views or ideas then get elected and proceed as far as you can go. But retain attachment to the jamaah for the sake of unity and momentum

Accountability:

Is both public and private, with no pressure for either method to be given preference. This is because accountability brings openess and frankness and recklessness and insincerity will be up for judgement

Reasons for decline

This project is to be considered an effort from every believer who subscribes to Islam and considers it a duty to raise the Word of Allah SWT.

This is not a sect, not a madhab, nor a political party, not a secretive organisation. It is neither of these because it

It should be considered a project, where any and everyone can contribute their efforts.

It is not a secular project, nor a political project, but rather it is an Islamic project.

Many Muslims are skeptical of various groups and movements currently present in the ummah. This skeptiscisim is justified in many cases, and is not justified in many cases.

There is good and bad, and there are different views on who is good and who is bad, and this project aims to get past these issues onto a more general position, where there is no differences, or at least where differences are minimised.

This is a project that has emanated from the ummah, is comprised of people from the ummah, both daees and scholars, united on core issues which are agreed upon, with ideas and objectives that are continously being improved and polished.

The aim is to achieve the maqam of khairun ummati, and the path that will be taken will be shaped by all who participate in the work, with a continous improvment process that should sharpen the aims and facilitate the actions and activities that are collectivly agreed upon.

All culture is subject to continous examination and improvements, with ulema from across the ummah constantly purifying and sharpening the culture, and their positions are elected positions, and their positions can change if the shura councils vote them in or vote them out.

The fundamental basis of the movement is that the ummah will select its leaders, the ummah will select its scholars, and the ummah will select what direction it wants to go, with differences minimised and objectives agreed upon via concensus.








a practical programme which would commit the Shabaab to studying the Qur’aan and its sciences, the Seerah, the lives of the Sahaabah and other than that from the Islamic culture, alongside the Halaqaat Al-Fikriyah (intellectual circles)

not a madrassah

not a masdhab

make contact with the prominent, influential and sincere personalities within the society, in all directions, like the university professors, the Khutabaa’ (pl. of Khateeb) of the Masaajid, the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ash-Sharee’ah, business men and those of the media in addition to other important personalities who have an influence, and then attempt to convince them of the thoughts of the Da’wah, so that they can fulfil their role and by themselves naturally

heavy and frank accounting but with hikma and wisdom and akhlaq

unison in global work, differences in regional and local work

mup is a unity project, and working with it is a recommended action for the purpoises of co-ordinating and unifying islamic ideas, culture, objectives. the amir of the mup does not possess any physical authority as he is not a khalifah with subjects. however that is an aim we are strving towards
